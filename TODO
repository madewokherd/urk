Server Messages

    we need to process all the normal server messages and 
make events for them: kicks, modes, parts, quits; we also 
need to be able to do them; and ctcp/actions


Server Stuff

    we should update the server name when you do /server, possibly 
even filling in the network name when we get that


Formatting

    We should support mIRC's and possibly besirc's formatting codes.
IRCWindow.write() would be a good place for this.


Network Prefs and Data

    some sort of system for keeping separating settings for 
networks so that we connect from a list on start


Theme System

    we need some sort of theme system, probably implemented via 
a script (we can only have one "default" way to handle things, 
so echoing from script.py would have to go)


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog


MEH likes closing tabs

    We need a way to close tabs.       


DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. If the theme system is good enough, maybe
we can make it handle both at once (with different themes).

        
MEH hates tabs

    the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on 
more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate


while 1: suckAtMainLoop()

    the main loop really sucks; we'd love to get rid of it 
(use gtk.main() somehow), but we can't find anything else that works
