Current components:

Ipv6 etc.

    We should have ipv6 support. Automatically and not to the detriment of
ipv4.


Highlighting
    
    Provide a means for highlighting. Maybe theme should trigger an event? :/


Partial SDI

    (Optionally) allow one main window per network.


Format more stuff

    Change formatting of tabs, tabs with new text, based on theme


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window




Things that can be done as separate components:


Functional Nicklist

    right-clicking the nicklist should do something


System Install

    a script (probably python) to do a system-wide install


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().


Ignore list

    Possibly doesn't merit a separate component, but this is a "standard irc
client feature" that's not essential to any current components.


DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Identd

    IRC servers appear to expect us to run an identd server for no good reason.


Notify

    IRC notify functions and events for scriptors.


replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
