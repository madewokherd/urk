before next release:

Hotlinking

    stop using webbrowser
    
    we need to figure out what to do when you click on nicks
    

Keyboard Shortcuts

    ^B, ^K etc.
    
    ^T for new server window?
    
    tab for nick completion
    
    we could just have an onKeypress event..scripts are good..


Take Back Stupid Decision

    own text shouldn't trigger onText


Commands that want colons

    things like /topic, /part, /kick, whatever else need to have :'s added in
the appropriate spots when we send them


Format more stuff

    Change formatting of tabs, tabs with new text


Start up Text Editor

    we need a nice way to start a text editor for editing scripts, probably a 
/edit command



before we can claim it's not beta:

Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window


Functional Nicklist

    right-clicking the nicklist should do something


System Install

    a script (probably python) to do a system-wide install


Highlighting
    
    Provide a means for highlighting. Maybe theme should trigger an event? :/



some time in the future:

DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().

        
replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
