Keyboard Shortcuts

    ^B, ^K etc.
    
    ^T for new server window?
    
    tab for nick completion


Format more stuff

    Change formatting of tabs, tabs with new text, based on theme


Ipv6 etc.

    We should have ipv6 support. Automatically and not to the detriment of
ipv4.


Cannot send to channel
    
    We need to show the various "cannot send to channel" message in the actual
channel windows.


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window


Functional Nicklist

    right-clicking the nicklist should do something


System Install

    a script (probably python) to do a system-wide install


Highlighting
    
    Provide a means for highlighting. Maybe theme should trigger an event? :/


DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().


Identd

    IRC servers appear to expect us to run an identd server for no good reason.

        
replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
