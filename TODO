-test Marc's stupid IDE

-the text entry should be selected by default

-we need to process all the normal server messages and make events for them: kicks, modes, parts, quits; we also need to be able to do them

-a nice /server command that lets us set the server and such

-some sort of system for keeping separating settings for networks so that we connect from a list on start

-ctrl+C doesn't work from channel cache

-a history for the text entry

-we need some sort of theme system, probably implemented via a script (we can only have one "default" way to handle things, so echoing from script.py would have to go)

-a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of "connect or edit connection" dialog

-the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate

-the main loop really sucks; we'd love to get rid of it (use gtk.main() somehow), but we can't find anything else that works
