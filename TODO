before the first release:

Documentation

    If not complete documentation, there should be enough there that someone
can get it running quickly and do some basic scripting (maybe a complete
description of onText and we can assume theme.py will have to be the
documentation for other events for now).



before we can claim it's not beta:

Channel Nicklist

    we should automatically save our nicklist size somehow


Network Prefs and Data

    some sort of system for keeping separating settings for 
networks so that we can connect from a list on start


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window


CTCP

    we should have a script or something for replying to CTCP's..and pinging 
people (MEH hates /ctcp ping and thinks we should have a separate /ping command
in this script that adds a proper human-readable timestamp)


Hotlinking

    url's, nicks, channels, etc. should be clickable



some time in the future:

DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().

        
MEH hates tabs

    the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on 
more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate


while 1: suckAtMainLoop()

    we should use idle timers or whatever they're called to read the queue
    
    (MEH thinks this is done)


replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
