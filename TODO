Current components:

#channel links

    The "Automatically join channel" thing should do something.


//commands

    Make the //commands evaluate python.


Partial SDI

    (Optionally) allow one main window per network.


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window



Things that can be done as separate components:


System Install

    a script (probably python) to do a system-wide install


Ignore list

    Possibly doesn't merit a separate component, but this is a "standard irc
client feature" that's not essential to any current components.


IPC

    Be able to send commands to urk remotely. Implement irc: links this way.


DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Identd

    IRC servers appear to expect us to run an identd server for no good reason.


Notify

    IRC notify functions and events for scriptors.


replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
