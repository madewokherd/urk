Server Messages

	we need to process all the normal server messages and 
make events for them: kicks, modes, parts, quits; we also 
need to be able to do them


Server Stuff

	we should update the server name when you do /server, possibly 
even filling in the network name when we get that


Network Prefs and Data

	some sort of system for keeping separating settings for 
networks so that we connect from a list on start


Theme System

	we need some sort of theme system, probably implemented via 
a script (we can only have one "default" way to handle things, 
so echoing from script.py would have to go)


Preferences UI

	a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog


MEH hates tabs

	the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on 
more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate


while 1: suckAtMainLoop()

	the main loop really sucks; we'd love to get rid of it 
(use gtk.main() somehow), but we can't find anything else that works
