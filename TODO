Server Messages

    we need to process all the normal server messages and 
make events for them: kicks, modes, parts, quits; we also 
need to be able to do them; and ctcp/actions

    (MEH thinks only topic and notice remains here)


Server Stuff

    /server may be (but doesn't seem to be) very broken

    we should update the server name when you do /server, possibly 
even filling in the network name when we get that

    we need some sort of "server list" that associates them with networks


Scripting system

    we need some nice /commands to handle scripts
    
    /reload is broken (doesn't seem to unload things)
    
    a way to automatically load a script when another script needs it would be
good


Structures

    we need to keep track of things like what channels we're on
and who else is on those channels; nicklists should be displayed

    (MEH thinks only nicklist display remains)


Network Prefs and Data

    some sort of system for keeping separating settings for 
networks so that we can connect from a list on start


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog


MEH likes closing tabs

    we need an event so we can react to the closing of tabs
    
    (closing status windows's should work)


CTCP

    we should have a script or something for replying to CTCP's..and maybe
pinging people


DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().

        
MEH hates tabs

    the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on 
more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate


while 1: suckAtMainLoop()

    we should use idle timers or whatever they're called to read the queue
    
    (MEH thinks this is done)


replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
