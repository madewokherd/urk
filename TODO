before the first release:

Channel Nicklist

    we should display nicks in the channel nicklist, properly sorted and
prefixed
    
    also, we need to do something so it starts with a sane size, and probably
make conf save our nicklist's size


Server Stuff

    we should update the server name when you do /server, possibly 
even filling in the network name when we get that (actually, we should
probably be updating the status window title any time we connect or disconnect
so the []'s are useful as an "are we connected?" hint)
    
    it needs to disconnect us if we're connected already and want to connect
    
    the file>>connect thing should probably have the same effect as /server

    we need some sort of "server list" that maps networks to servers


Scripting system

    we need some nice /commands to handle scripts
    
    /reload is broken (doesn't seem to unload things)
    
    a way to automatically load a script when another script needs it would be
good
    
    we should really have run_command somewhere things that aren't script.py can
import


MEH likes closing tabs

    closing status windows needs to work (and disconnect us from the network)


Documentation

    If not complete documentation, there should be enough there that someone
can get it running quickly and do some basic scripting (maybe a complete
description of onText and we can assume theme.py will have to be the
documentation for other events for now).



before we can claim it's not beta:

Network Prefs and Data

    some sort of system for keeping separating settings for 
networks so that we can connect from a list on start


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window


CTCP

    we should have a script or something for replying to CTCP's..and pinging 
people (MEH hates /ctcp ping and thinks we should have a separate /ping command
in this script that adds a proper human-readable timestamp)


Hotlinking

    url's, nicks, channels, etc. should be clickable



some time in the future:

DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().

        
MEH hates tabs

    the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on 
more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate


while 1: suckAtMainLoop()

    we should use idle timers or whatever they're called to read the queue
    
    (MEH thinks this is done)


replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
