before we can claim it's not beta:

Network Prefs and Data

    some sort of system for keeping separating settings for 
networks so that we can connect from a list on start


Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window


Hotlinking

    url's, nicks, channels, etc. should be clickable



some time in the future:

DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().

        
MEH hates tabs

    the mdi system might need revised--some people like to be on 
more channels than tabs can reasonably accomodate


while 1: suckAtMainLoop()

    we should use idle timers or whatever they're called to read the queue
    
    (MEH thinks this is done)


replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
