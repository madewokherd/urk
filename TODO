before we can claim it's not beta:

Preferences UI

    a preferences ui, probably with a separate sort of 
"connect or edit connection" dialog

    we want a number of "preflets" rather than one gigantic prefs window


Hotlinking

    we need to figure out what to do when you click on nicks


Functional Nicklist

    right-clicking the nicklist should do something


Keyboard Shortcuts for Formatting

    ^B, ^K etc.


System Install

    a script (probably python) to do a system-wide install


some time in the future:

Start up Text Editor

    we need a nice way to start a text editor for editing scripts, probably a 
/edit command


DCC Stuff

    DCC server, sends, chat, etc. We should support mIRC's "passive" DCC.


Logging

    We'll need this at some point. Most likely we'll just put logging code
in IRCWindow.write().

        
replacements for stuff

    It'd be cool to have alternative ui's and conf's..maybe we could optionally
get rid of some dependencies by using built-in python things.
